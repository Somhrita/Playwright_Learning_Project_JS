# ðŸ’» Test Automation Framework | Learning Project

This is a learning project that demonstrates various automation techniques using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with JavaScript. The project covers multiple automation scenarios such as interacting with checkboxes, file uploads, handling multiple windows, managing alerts, and more.

The goal of this project is to explore and practice Playwright's capabilities in real-world scenarios.
